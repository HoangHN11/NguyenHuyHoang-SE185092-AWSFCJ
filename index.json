Project Overview Jewelry E-Commerce Platform is a modern online retail system built on a cloud infrastructure, designed for small and medium-sized jewelry businesses. The project aims to help these enterprises transition from traditional sales models to a secure, flexible, and automated digital environment.\nThe platform integrates a ReactJS front-end, a .NET Core backend hosted on Amazon Lightsail, and a MySQL database for managing products, users, and orders efficiently.\nStatic assets such as product images and web content are stored on Amazon S3 and globally distributed through Amazon CloudFront, ensuring optimal speed and security. Amazon Cognito handles user authentication, while Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Lightsail Snapshots provide monitoring, auditing, and disaster recovery.\nThis project delivers a cost-effective, easy-to-operate, and scalable e-commerce solution tailored for small and medium jewelry businesses.\nProject Objectives Develop a responsive, user-friendly jewelry e-commerce website that works seamlessly across devices. Centralize management of products, inventory, and orders. Ensure ≥99.9% uptime through automated backup and recovery. Maintain infrastructure costs below USD 65/month using Lightsail and AWS Free Tier resources. Business Value Small jewelry shops often face challenges related to high infrastructure costs and limited technical expertise. This solution helps:\nReduce operational costs with predictable Lightsail pricing. Automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency. Enhance brand trust through system stability and robust data protection. 2. Problem Analysis 2.1 Current Situation The jewelry retail market is rapidly shifting to online channels, driven by consumer demand for personalization, transparency, and high-quality digital experiences — especially among younger generations. However, most existing e-commerce systems face critical limitations:\nPoor user experience: Slow page loading, outdated design, and lack of interactive features such as AR try-on. Lack of trust: Customers hesitate to purchase high-value items (gold, diamonds) due to concerns over data security and authenticity. Insecure, outdated infrastructure: Many legacy systems store passwords or customer data in plain text, making them vulnerable to attacks and limiting scalability. 2.2 Key Challenges Speed and reliability:\nJewelry relies heavily on high-resolution imagery and interactive content (e.g., 360° views, AR try-on). Without a global CDN, loading such content becomes slow and unreliable, resulting in high cart abandonment rates.\nSecurity and fraud risks:\nE-commerce platforms are prime targets for cyberattacks. Without a Web Application Firewall (WAF), systems are exposed to SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and data breaches. Storing credentials directly in code poses severe risks of unauthorized access.\nData loss and recovery issues:\nTransactions and inventory records must be 100% accurate. Local storage risks permanent data loss if hardware fails. Without durable storage like Amazon S3, essential data such as invoices and product images could become irretrievable.\nLimited monitoring and control:\nWithout centralized monitoring tools such as CloudWatch, operators can only detect issues after customers report them, increasing MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) and damaging user trust.\n2.3 Stakeholder Impact Stakeholder Key Impact Customers Gain confidence through fast, transparent, and secure online shopping. Operations Team Easier system monitoring, with automated backup and recovery processes. Developers Faster development through modular architecture with API Gateway and Lightsail. Business Owners Continuous business operations, reduced data loss risk, and stronger competitive advantage. 2.4 Business Consequences Revenue loss: Slow performance and poor UX reduce conversions and increase cart abandonment. Reputation and compliance risks: Data breaches (from missing WAF or Secrets Manager) can result in heavy penalties and long-term brand damage — especially in the luxury goods sector. Higher operational costs: Lack of automated monitoring and backup increases manpower and recovery time. Limited scalability: Legacy systems fail to adapt to fast market growth, causing missed business opportunities. 3. Solution Architecture 3.1 Architecture Overview The proposed architecture is a high-performance e-commerce platform deployed on the AWS Cloud (Singapore Region) using a separated SPA/microservices design. This enables dynamic processing and high scalability:\nStatic Frontend Delivery: React frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) are stored on S3 and served via CloudFront CDN for global low-latency delivery. Dynamic Backend Processing: Business logic and data (catalogs, carts, orders) are handled through a .NET API hosted on Lightsail, exposed securely via API Gateway. 3.2 AWS Services Used Category AWS Service Primary Function Networking \u0026amp; Edge Route 53, CloudFront, WAF, ACM DNS routing, CDN delivery, web protection, SSL management Compute \u0026amp; API API Gateway, Lightsail API endpoint management and backend application hosting Identity \u0026amp; Access Cognito, Secrets Manager Authentication/authorization and secure credential management Storage \u0026amp; Database S3, Lightsail MySQL Static asset storage and relational database for transactional data Resilience \u0026amp; Backup AWS Backup, S3 Versioning, Glacier, Lightsail Snapshots Automated backups, archiving, and data version control Monitoring \u0026amp; Audit CloudWatch, CloudTrail Real-time performance tracking and API activity auditing 3.3 Component Design Presentation Layer (Frontend): Static React site hosted on S3, distributed via CloudFront. AWS WAF provides edge-level protection from common exploits. Application Layer (Backend): API Gateway validates Cognito tokens, manages API requests, and enforces throttling. Lightsail Instance (Ubuntu) runs the .NET Core API for handling business logic (orders, products, payments). Data Layer: MySQL Database on Lightsail manages all relational data; credentials stored securely in Secrets Manager. Amazon S3 stores user uploads, product images, and other static assets. 3.4 Security Architecture Edge Protection: WAF filters malicious requests; ACM enforces HTTPS encryption. User Authentication: All login and registration are handled by Cognito with secure token validation. Infrastructure Security: Secrets Manager ensures sensitive credentials are never stored in plain text. Auditing: CloudTrail records every API call for compliance and traceability. 3.5 Scalability and Observability Global scalability via CloudFront caching and distribution. Unlimited storage growth on S3 for media assets. Resource monitoring through CloudWatch metrics, enabling proactive scaling decisions. 4.

Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/1-worklog/1.10-week10/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The following information is for reference purposes only.

Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section).

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution.
