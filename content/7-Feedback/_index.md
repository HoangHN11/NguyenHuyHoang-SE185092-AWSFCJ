### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
I highly appreciate the positive and professional working environment. The workspace is spacious and comfortable, which creates favorable conditions for productivity. In addition, my colleagues are friendly and supportive, and the mentors are highly dedicated, always willing to guide and assist us whenever we encounter difficulties. Their support helped me integrate quickly and work effectively throughout the internship.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The level of support I received from my mentors and team administrators was exceptional. They provided enthusiastic and dedicated guidance, especially in dealing with complex technical issues related to systems and cloud technologies. Beyond simple supervision, the mentors actively created an effective learning environment by sharing valuable resources and offering timely support when needed, which significantly accelerated my learning progress during the internship.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
Although the internship allowed me to apply some fundamental knowledge from my major in Information Security, I was also exposed to a wide range of new technical content, particularly in web development and specialized cloud services, which were not fully covered in my academic program. As a result, I sometimes needed more time to adapt and keep pace with other interns who had a more closely related background.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
As I was continuously exposed to new technical domains and topics, the internship provided valuable opportunities for intensive learning and rapid personal skill development. These experiences played an important role in enhancing both my professional knowledge and practical abilities.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company’s culture strongly promotes collaboration and mentorship. Team members are friendly, open, and always supportive of interns. The overall team spirit is dynamic and enthusiastic, driven by a shared desire to learn and contribute positively to project goals.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The internship policies and overall support were highly satisfactory. Interns were encouraged to actively ask questions and seek clarification whenever facing difficulties. The structured guidance and proactive support from mentors were designed to maximize learning outcomes and significantly enhance professional growth throughout the program.
