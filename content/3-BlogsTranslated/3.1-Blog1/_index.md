## Solution Overview

Advanced digital technologies are revolutionizing the energy sector, enabling organizations to achieve sustainability goals while reducing costs and carbon emissions.  
According to McKinsey, digital transformation in the energy sector could unlock **$1.6 trillion in value** by 2035, helping reduce **20–30% of operating costs** and **5% of carbon emissions**.

As the industry moves toward distributed power generation models integrating renewable energy, businesses need smart solutions like **digital grids, AI-powered energy orchestration**, and **real-time monitoring platforms**.

**TCS's Smart Power Plant solution** was created to meet this need — delivering **0.5% efficiency gains**, **8% NOx reduction**, and **8–10% improvement in renewable energy forecast accuracy**.  
Built on the **AWS** platform, this solution leverages **AI/ML** power to process real-time data from thousands of energy sensors across multiple locations.
