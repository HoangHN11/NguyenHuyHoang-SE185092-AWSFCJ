During my internship at AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED from 08-09-2025 to 08-12-2025, I was given a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world professional tasks and gain practical working experience.

Throughout this internship, I took part in a web development project aimed at building an online jewelry store. My main responsibilities included designing essential features, developing backend functions, and improving the user interface. Through this project, I significantly improved my web programming skills, had my first exposure to the C# programming language, enhanced my English communication ability, and strengthened my teamwork and interpersonal skills.

Regarding work attitude, I always strived to complete assigned tasks with high quality, strictly followed workplace regulations, and actively cooperated with colleagues to maintain a positive and efficient working environment.

To provide an objective evaluation of my internship performance, I conducted a self-assessment based on the following criteria:
